## 1\. Project Overview

This project aims to focuse on leveraging historical car insurance claim data to enhance our strategic planning and marketing efforts in **South Africa**. ACIS is committed to developing cutting-edge risk and predictive analytics, and this initiative is central to that mission.

This project involves deep diving into past claims data to understand underlying patterns, identify key risk factors, and ultimately, inform a more optimized marketing strategy.

## 2\. Business Objectives

The core objectives of this analysis are:

  * **Optimize Marketing Strategy:** Provide data-driven insights to refine current marketing campaigns, ensuring more effective targeting and resource allocation.
  * **Discover "Low-Risk" Targets:** Identify customer segments or profiles that exhibit a demonstrably lower risk of filing insurance claims.
  * **Enable Premium Reduction:** Based on low-risk findings, propose opportunities to reduce insurance premiums for attractive client segments, thereby enhancing ACIS's competitiveness and attracting new clients.

## 3\. Key Analysis Areas

To deliver on the business objectives, this project will encompass analysis and modeling in the following crucial areas:

  * **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

      * Cleaning, validating, and transforming raw historical claims data.
      * Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
      * Feature engineering from existing variables to create more predictive attributes (e.g., claim frequency, claim severity, policy duration).

  * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

      * Understanding the distribution and characteristics of claims data (e.g., claim types, amounts, demographics of claimants).
      * Identifying initial patterns, correlations, and anomalies.
      * Visualizing key trends and relationships between policyholder attributes and claim behavior.

  * **Risk Assessment & Predictive Modeling:**

      * **Low-Risk Profile Identification:** Developing statistical or machine learning models to predict the likelihood and severity of future claims.
      * Utilizing models like Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines to assess risk factors.
      * Segmenting policyholders based on their predicted risk profiles.

  * **Customer Segmentation:**

      * Applying clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group customers based on their behavioral patterns, demographic data, and risk profiles.
      * Identifying distinct "low-risk" segments for targeted premium reductions and marketing.

  * **Marketing Strategy Optimization:**

      * Analyzing the characteristics of identified low-risk segments to inform targeted marketing campaigns.
      * Proposing strategies for attracting these specific client types.
      * (Future consideration if data permits) Assessing the impact of past marketing efforts on acquisition and retention.

  * **Reporting & Visualization:**

      * Creating clear, concise, and actionable visualizations and reports to communicate findings to stakeholders.
      * Developing dashboards to monitor key performance indicators related to risk profiles and marketing effectiveness.

## 4\. Data

The core dataset for this project is **historical car insurance claim data**.

  * **Source:** [Specify Data Source, e.g., ACIS Internal Database, Data Lake]
  * **Content:** [Briefly describe key columns, e.g., policyholder demographics (age, location, occupation), vehicle details (make, model, year), policy details (coverage type, premium), claim history (date, type, amount, status).]

## 5\. Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlphaCare-Insurance-Solutions/AlphaCare-Insurance-Risk-Analytics.git
    cd AlphaCare-Insurance-Risk-Analytics
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    py -m venv venv  # Use 'py' as your Python launcher
    .\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows PowerShell
    # source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS or Git Bash
    ```
3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If `requirements.txt` is not yet created, you can manually install: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter`)

## 6\. Usage

To run the analysis and explore the notebooks:

1.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if not already active):
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2.  **Start Jupyter Lab/Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab # or jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to open and run the analytical notebooks.
4.  Execute the scripts in the `src/` directory as needed.
